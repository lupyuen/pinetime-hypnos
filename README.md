# Hypnos

__(This fork of [`pinetime-hypnos`](https://github.com/endian-albin/pinetime-hypnos) supports VSCode Debugging. See [`.vscode/launch.json`](.vscode/launch.json))__

This is a work-in-progress [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)-based firmware for the
[PineTime](https://www.pine64.org/pinetime/) and P8 smartwatches. Contributions are welcome!

## Getting started

Follow Zephyr's [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html)
up to step 3.2 "Get the Zephyr source code". Here you should run the commands below
instead of the ones in the guide:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/endian-albin/pinetime-hypnos
$ cd pinetime-hypnos
$ west init -l app/
$ west update
```

Then complete the remaining steps.

Optionally disable logging to save system resources:
```
$ export LOGGING="off"
```

Build the firmware for either `pinetime` or `p8` (replace `<board>` below):
```
$ cd app/
$ west build -p -b <board> hypnos
```

Install:

```
$ west flash
```
